##Legacy data

####This is a ruby method for transforming a hash whose values are arrays, and transforming it into a hash where each element in the arrays has its value as the key of the array to which it originally belonged

To use it just copy the code from the lib/legacy_data.rb file and paste it into a ruby client ([Here's a link](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/installing-ruby) that helped me install ruby on my machine). Then type â€˜legacy_data(your-hash-here)' in the client.

We built this project while we were students at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). [This exercise](http://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/lessons/legacy-data-conversion-prime-sifting-nth-prime) was meant to introduce us to writing our own ruby methods.
